       <h1><u>Array</u></h1>
       <p>An array is a collection of similar data elements.</p> <p>These data elements have the same data type. The elements of the array are stored in adjacent memory locations and are referenced by an index (also known as the subscript).</p>
        Arrays are generally used when we want to store large amount of similar type of data. But they have the following limitations: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Arrays are of fixed size.</li>
          <li>Data elements are stored in contiguous memory locations (stored one after the other without any gaps) which may not be always available.</li>
          <li>Insertion and deletion of elements can be problematic because of shifting of elements from their positions.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>An array marks of size 10 is declared. The first element will be stored in marks[0], the second element in marks [1], so on and so forth.</p>
        <p>Therefore, the n<sup>th</sup> element is stored in (n - 1)<sup>th</sup> position of marks</p>
        <p>An array marks of size 10 is declared. The first element will be stored in marks[0], the second element in marks [1], so on and so forth.</p>
        <p>The are fundamental for managing buffers for input/output operations, representing matrices and grids in mathematical and graphical applications and dynamically allocating memory when the size of the data set is not known beforehand.</p>
        <br>

        <h1><u>Linked Lists</u></h1>
        <p>A linked list is a very flexible, dynamic data structure in which elements (called nodes) form a sequential list.</p>
        <p>In comparison to arrays, a programmer need not worry about how many elements will be stored in the linked list.</p>
        <p>Every node in the list points to the next node in the list. Therefore, in a linked list, every node contains the following two types of data:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The value of the node or any other data that corresponds to that node.</li>
          <li>A pointer or link to the next node in the list.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="Screenshot 2024-04-25 151241.png" alt="array image">
        <p>The last node in the list contains a NULL pointer to indicate that it is the end or tail of the list. Since the memory for a node is dynamically allocated when it is added to the list, the total number of nodes that may be added to a list is limited only by the amount of memory available</p>
        <br>
        <p>Linked lists are used where the size of the data set may change frequently such as in dynamic data structures like stack, queues, and hash tables.</p>
        <p>Linked lists are also utilized in implementing advanced data structures like graph and trees where nodes need to be interconnected flexibly.</p>
        <p>Additionally, they find applications in file systems, memory management algorithms and certain types of caching mechanisms.</p>
